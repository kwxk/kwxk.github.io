    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I am a dedicated and results-driven professional with a strong background in Information Technology and Informatics. I have a deep passion for analyzing data and extracting meaningful insights to make informed decisions. I firmly believe that data is power, as it enables us to manipulate real-life scenarios and take actionable steps towards achieving our goals. My college education at Rutgers University, where I pursued a B.A. in Information Technology & Informatics with a minor in Healthcare Administration, provided me with a solid foundation in both technical and healthcare domains. This unique blend of knowledge allows me to leverage data-driven approaches to drive positive change in the healthcare industry and make a lasting impact on people's lives.
    </p>

    <p>
      Throughout my professional journey, I've gained valuable experience in infrastructure engineering, systems administration, and DevOps practices. I have worked with renowned organizations such as Citigroup as a Network Engineer and Twitch-Amazon Web Services as a DevOps Intern, where I successfully developed and implemented innovative solutions using technologies like Ansible, Terraform, and Python. My expertise in analyzing complex data sets, coupled with my technical skills, enables me to uncover patterns, identify trends, and make strategic decisions that align with organizational objectives. I'm driven by the desire to use data as a powerful tool to meet end goals, not only for myself but also for the teams and individuals I work with.
